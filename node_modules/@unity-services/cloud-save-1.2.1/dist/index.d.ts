/**
 * Cloud Save API
 * # Introduction This is the API specification for the Unity Cloud Save service that allows player state to be persisted from a game client. To use this API, you must first enable it through the Unity Gaming Services dashboard.  # General Information Cloud Save Data are small JSON serializable data, up to 1KB in size, stored as key/value pairs. Limits: - Maximum 16 KB in size per slot - Maximum 255 characters per slot name - Maximum 200 data slots per player  ## Rate Limits The API has rate limiting in place. The endpoints are limited to 600 requests per minute on a per-player basis. The API responds with a `429` HTTP status code if the rate limit is exceeded. It will also respond with a `Retry-After` header to be used in conjunction with a client\'s retry logic. The value is the number of seconds until a request for the given player will be accepted.
